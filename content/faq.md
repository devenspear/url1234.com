# Frequently Asked Questions

## Questions & Answers

### Is alcoholism really not a disease?
We believe alcoholism is a response to pain and trauma, not a chronic disease. When we heal the underlying pain, the compulsion to drink naturally dissolves. This isn't about willpower - it's about addressing root causes.

### Do you really guarantee success?
Yes, we offer a 100% guarantee. If you complete our program and don't experience the transformation we promise, we'll refund your investment. We can make this guarantee because our approach addresses causes, not symptoms.

### What if my loved one isn't ready?
Readiness is crucial for transformation. We work with families to help create the conditions for readiness, but we can't force someone to heal. Our assessment process helps determine genuine readiness for change.

### What makes Kaleidoscope different from rehab?
Traditional rehab focuses on abstinence through willpower and coping mechanisms. We focus on healing the pain that drives the drinking. When the pain is gone, the desire to drink disappears naturally.

### What's in The Little Book?
The Little Book contains our core beliefs about transformation and healing. It challenges conventional wisdom about addiction and offers a new perspective on what's possible for those who are suffering.

### Do you use plant medicine?
Plant medicine can be a powerful tool for trauma healing when used in the right context with proper preparation and integration. We use whatever modalities are most appropriate for each individual's healing journey.

### What if I've already tried everything?
Many of our clients have been through multiple rehabs, therapy programs, and 12-step meetings. Our approach is fundamentally different because we address trauma and pain at the deepest levels.

### Is this spiritual or clinical?
We integrate both spiritual and clinical approaches. Healing happens on multiple levels - mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual. We use whatever combination of modalities serves each person's transformation.

### How long does the program take?
The intensive retreat is 28 days, but transformation begins during the preparation phase and continues through our lifetime ForeverCareâ„¢ support. Real healing happens quickly when we address root causes.

### Can families be involved?
Absolutely. Addiction affects entire family systems, and healing often requires family participation. We offer family healing sessions and ongoing support for loved ones throughout the process.
