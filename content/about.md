# About Us

## Mission Statement
We are revolutionizing alcohol recovery by addressing the root cause of addiction: trauma and pain. Unlike traditional rehab that focuses on abstinence, we focus on healing - making the desire to drink simply disappear.

## Market Challenge
The $53 billion US alcohol recovery industry has a 90% failure rate. Traditional approaches treat symptoms, not causes. We're changing that.

## Company Story
Kaleidoscope was founded on the belief that alcoholism isn't a disease - it's a response to pain. When we heal the pain, the need for alcohol naturally dissolves. Our founders experienced this transformation firsthand and dedicated their lives to sharing it with others.
